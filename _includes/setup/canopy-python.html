  <p>Installing everything you need
    on your own can be a bit difficult so
    we recommend just installing
    <a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/">
      Enthought Canopy</a>, which comes in
    <a href="https://www.enthought.com/downloads/">free</a>
    and
    <a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/academic/">academic</a>
    versions for Mac, Windows, and GNU/Linux.</p>
